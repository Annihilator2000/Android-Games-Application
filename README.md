# Android-Java-Game
This was a group-project for CSC207(Fall)
Our team decided to create a 3 in one android game app. We also integrated SQLLite for local user database that can be used to 
store the statistics of the users that play on that device. You can also download the .apk that can be installed directly on your device to play the app.
All the file eg. graddle,.bat, files required to run the app on a simulator are the available in the repo. 
The main java files are located in: app/src/main/java/com/example/final_game/
We plan to launch the app in playstore soon. 
It was a enriching experience full of new learnings and great time collaborating with team members.
