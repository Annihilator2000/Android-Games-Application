# Android-Java-Game
This was a group-project for CSC207(Fall) which is a second year course on Software Design in University Of Toronto.
Our team consisting of 6 members developed 3 different games in one android application. We also integrated SQLLite for local user database that can be used to 
store the statistics and login credentials of the users that play on that device. We also added two different sign in options; one local to the database and one using google. You can also download the .apk that can be installed directly on your device to play the app.
All the file eg. graddle,.bat, files required to run the app on a simulator are the available in the repo. 
The main java files are located in: app/src/main/java/com/example/final_game/
We plan to launch the app in playstore soon. 
It was a enriching experience full of new learnings and we all had a great time collaborating with each other.
